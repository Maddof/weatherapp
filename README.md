# Weather APP

_Simple weather app using api from weatherapi.com_

You can search for any city and get a simple forecast and todays and current weather status.

The UI is based on a style called "glassmorphism".

The background is abstract.

## What I learned

- Asynchronous js
- Promises
- Async/Await
- Fetch API

## Areas of improvement

Protecting API keys.
Adding some cool animations?
